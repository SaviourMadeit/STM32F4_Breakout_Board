This repository contains the design files, schematics, and documentation for the STM32F4 Breakout Board.
This breakout board is designed to simplify the development process by providing easy access to essential 
features of the STM32F4 microcontroller, including voltage regulation, communication protocols, debugging interfaces, and indicator LEDs.

## Features

- 3.3V Voltage Regulator: The breakout board includes a 3.3V voltage regulator to ensure stable power supply for 
                              connected peripherals and the STM32F4 microcontroller.

- 3.3V Power Pin: Provides a convenient 3.3V power pin for external components or modules that require a regulated power supply.

- LED Indicator: An indicator LED for visual feedback or status indication during development.

- Communication Protocols:

  - SPI: Headers and connectors for Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication.
  - UART: Interface for Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) communication.
  - I2C: Connectors for Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) communication.

- Serial Wire Debugger Pins: Dedicated pins for Serial Wire Debugging (SWD) to assist in code development and debugging processes.

## Contents

- Schematics: Contains the schematic,and footprint files detailing the board's layout and connections.
- Gerber_Files: Gerber files for PCB fabrication and Assemblying.
- Documentation: Additional documentation, usage guides, and pinout details.
- Examples: Sample code examples demonstrating the use of different communication protocols with the breakout board.

## Usage

1. Hardware Setup: Connect the necessary peripherals or components to the designated headers and pins on the breakout board.
   
2. Power Supply: Ensure a stable power supply of max 5v is provided to the breakout board through the appropriate power input VIN pin.

3. Communication: Utilize the provided headers and connectors to establish communication using SPI, UART, or I2C protocols.

4. Debugging: Utilize the Serial Wire Debugger pins for development and debugging of code. Refer to the documentation for more details on debugging setup.
